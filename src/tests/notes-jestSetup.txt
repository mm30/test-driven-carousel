Why put the Jest setup file in the /tests directory? 
Although the Jest setup file isn't a test file, it des run in the same environment as the test files. 
That means that it should follow the Jest-specific linter rules defined in src/tests/.eslintrc.js

At this point, the setup file satisfies either set of linter rules, but that could change if the test setup grows more elaborate.

It's always useful to remember which environment each JavaScript file in your project 
runs in, and to keep it in a directory with an appropriate ESLint configuration.
Ideally, we'd move jest.config.js and wallaby.js into a more precisely configured directory, but (as of 2018) 
Jest and Wallaby expect those files to live in the project root.

- Note -
With the jest setup file in place, we no longer need to run Enzyme's configure() method in each test file.
